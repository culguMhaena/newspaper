- The Declaration of Independence of Kosovo was drafted by a group of 15 people, led by former President Fatmir Sejdiu and former Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. The draft was based on the recommendations of the Ahtisaari Plan, a proposal by the UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari that aimed to resolve the status of Kosovo.
- The Declaration of Independence of Kosovo was read aloud by Thaci in front of thousands of people who gathered in the capital city of Pristina. The crowd cheered and waved flags, while fireworks and music filled the air. The declaration was also broadcast live on television and radio.
- The Declaration of Independence of Kosovo was recognized by 116 out of 193 UN member states as of April 2021. The first country to recognize it was Afghanistan, followed by the United States, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. The last country to recognize it was Bangladesh, in February 2020. Some of the countries that have not recognized it include Serbia, Russia, China, India, Brazil and Spain.
- The Declaration of Independence of Kosovo was challenged by Serbia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is the principal judicial organ of the UN. In July 2010, the ICJ issued an advisory opinion that stated that the declaration did not violate international law or UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which established an interim administration for Kosovo in 1999. However, the opinion also stated that it did not imply a right to secession or a recognition of statehood.
- The Declaration of Independence of Kosovo was followed by a series of political and economic developments in the new country. Some of these include the adoption of a constitution, the establishment of diplomatic relations with other states, the accession to various international organizations and agreements, the creation of a security force and a central bank, and the implementation of reforms and projects in various sectors.

The Declaration of Independence of Kosovo is a milestone in the history of Kosovo and its people. It represents their aspiration for freedom, democracy and peace after years of conflict and oppression. It also marks a challenge for the international community and its role in supporting and respecting the will and rights of different nations.
